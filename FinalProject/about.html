        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p class="about bout">Our Leaders
            NRDC was founded in 1970 by a group of law students and attorneys at the forefront of the environmental
            movement.
            Today's leadership team and board of trustees makes sure the organization
            continues to work to ensure the rights of all people to clean air, clean water, and healthy communities.</p>

        <h2 class="history">History</h2>
        <p class="about">For nearly 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive.
            As the world’s leading conservation organization, WWF works in more than 100 countries. At every level,
            we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect
            communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.</p>

        <h2>People</h2>
        <p class="about bout"> People are at the center of everything we do. WWF works to help local communities conserve the
            natural
            resources they depend upon, transform markets and policies toward sustainability, and protect and restore
            species and their habitats. Our efforts ensure that the value of nature is reflected in decision-making from
            a local to a global scale.
            WWF connects cutting-edge conservation science with the collective power of our partners in the field,
            more than one million supporters in the United States and five million globally, as well as partnerships
            with communities, companies, and governments.</p>

        <h2>Today</h2>
        <p class="about bout"> Today, human activities put more pressure on nature than ever before, but it’s also people who
            have the
            power to change this trajectory. Together, we can address the greatest threats to life on this planet and
            protect the natural resources that sustain and inspire us.
