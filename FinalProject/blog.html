        <p class="fact">On April 28, Workers’ Memorial Day, at the reported urging of Tyson Foods, 
        President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act (DPA) with the stated goal of keeping meat processing
         (slaughterhouses) open through the COVID-19 crisis. In doing so, the President is attempting to trample over 
         state decisions intended to improve worker safety while responding to outbreaks of COVID-19 at many slaughterhouses. </p>
        <img src="bleu.png" id="hotspot" alt="hotspots" class="firstcross cross">
        <p class="tyson fact">The President made clear in 
            remarks that the primary aim of the order was to insulate the food giant from liability, 
         not ensure the safety of the food supplies or the workers who produce it. Adding insult to injury, this comes as calls 
         to use the DPA to ensure health workers have access to adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) go unheeded. These 
         actions are callous and dangerous.
         The top COVID-19 hotspots nationwide are all linked to slaughterhouses with active outbreaks, and there are currently 
         6,500 slaughterhouse workers with COVID infections or exposure across the nation’s 6,200 facilities. Even in this dangerous 
         sector where workers go to work every day knowing that they face high rates of severe injuries and harsh conditions, workers 
         have been staying home, fearing for their lives; some are walking out protesting this order and related commitments to keep 
         plants open at all costs. Forcing plants to stay open without mandating adequate safety measures is not only dangerous, it
          also undermines the efforts of localities to force companies to look out for the basic safety of workers.
         Simply put: If companies like Tyson, JBS, and Smithfield are not ready to be responsible for the bare minimum of worker safety,
          then they are not ready to reopen. Our government has a responsibility to make sure that workers—especially those deemed 
          essential or required to work—are protected.

        The Keystone XL tar sands pipeline got knocked down again this week when a federal judge 
        invalidated Nationwide Permit 12, a key water-crossing permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps 
        of Engineers and used by Keystone XL as well as many other pipeline projects. The permit has 
        been routinely used to help pipelines avoid thorough environmental reviews and fast-track their approval process.</p>
        <img src="bleu.png" id="keystone" alt="pipeline" class="nextcross cross">
        <p class="oil fact">“The Trump administration’s
             ongoing effort to give out goodies to Big Oil hit another setback,”
 says NRDC attorney Cecilia Segal. “Whether they like it or not, the Corps cannot skirt foundational environmental laws.”
Challenged by a coalition of conservation and landowner groups, including NRDC, Nationwide Permit
 12 allowed the Army Corps to avoid fully assessing the impacts of pipelines on local waterways, lands,
  wildlife, and communities. The court’s ruling now prohibits the agency from using this permit for pipelines
   nationwide and could block the construction of Keystone XL across hundreds of water crossings.
“Projects like the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline will remain stalled as long as the administration keeps
 trying to illegally fast-track them,” Segal says.
TC Energy’s Keystone XL has now been the center of a ping-ponging legal and legislative battle for more 
than a decade. The proposed pipeline would carry 830 million barrels of tar sands oil per day from Canada
 to oil refineries on the Gulf Coast. In addition to threatening water, wildlife, and public health along 
 its route, the fossil fuel infrastructure would also lock in more climate-devastating carbon pollution.
President Obama agreed the risks were too high and vetoed the project in 2015, but President Trump revived
 it soon after taking office. His administration has since made numerous attempts to fast-track its approval,
  and the government of Alberta, Canada, announced just last month that it would invest billions to help the 
  long-delayed project move forward with construction on the U.S.-Canada border as early as this spring.
But the latest courtroom win now bolsters the continuing fight by Indigeneous groups, conservationists,
 and landowners along the pipeline’s route to block its construction.

     <p class="fact">
        As hurricane season looms especially large this year, and COVID-19 reveals the deep cracks and fissures 
        in our nation’s response preparedness, North Carolina is gearing up to release its long-awaited plan to
         bolster climate resilience. The state’s “Climate Risk Assessment and Resilience Plan” is expected to 
         outline a comprehensive strategy to help North Carolina stay ahead of the ever-escalating climate crisis.
          It can’t come soon enough.
        </p>
 <img src="bleu.png" id="hurricane" alt="hurricanes" class="lastcross cross">
 <p class= "carolina fact">But publishing a plan does not automatically
equate to implementing a plan. The success of North Carolina’s
 resilience plan will ultimately be determined by the steps Governor Roy Cooper, the legislature, and state’s
  agencies take to implement the recommendations. That takes leadership and a firm directive from on high that 
  climate resilience is a priority for the state—a mandate that Governor Cooper has fortunately made abundantly clear.
When the Governor signed Executive Order 80 in October 2018 he instructed state agencies to integrate climate
 adaptation and resiliency planning into their policies, programs, and operations, recognizing that the climate
  crisis touches nearly every aspect of government planning and decision-making. In another major step forward,
   the Governor called for the state to develop a resilience plan.
Eighteen months later, much now hinges on the effectiveness and implementation of that plan. At its core, the 
resilience plan should feature two bedrock components that future climate efforts can further build upon.
Assess the Climate Risks and Prepare for Future Climate Impacts
A climate risk assessment should identify vulnerable infrastructure assets, communities that have the most 
vulnerable housing stock, public safety facilities located in harm’s way and a host of other much-needed 
information. Such an assessment could be developed by drawing on the recently completed North Carolina Climate Science Report.
