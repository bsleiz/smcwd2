    <main class="kids"> <p>For nearly 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive.
     As the world’s leading conservation organization, WWF works in more than 100 countries. At every level,
         we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect 
         communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.
        People are at the center of everything we do. WWF works to help local communities conserve the natural
         resources they depend upon, transform markets and policies toward sustainability, and protect and restore 
         species and their habitats. Our efforts ensure that the value of nature is reflected in decision-making from a local to a global scale.
         WWF connects cutting-edge conservation science with the collective power of our partners in the field, 
        more than one million supporters in the United States and five million globally, as well as partnerships 
        with communities, companies, and governments.
     Today, human activities put more pressure on nature than ever before, but it’s also people who have the 
        power to change this trajectory. Together, we can address the greatest threats to life on this planet and protect the natural resources that sustain and inspire us.
